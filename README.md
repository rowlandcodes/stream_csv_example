# Example of streaming from Ecto database to Plug downloaded CSV

This code demonstrates how to stream data from an ecto query to an exported CSV.

It is the demo code for my blog post [here](https://row.land/codes/stream-csv).

## Usage

Run:
```
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

The code should serve a download link on `localhost:4000`.
